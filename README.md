VOCALINK is a DIY mouth tracking solution built on [Project Babble](https://github.com/Project-Babble/ProjectBabble) that brings natural facial expressions to your VR avatar. Tired of your avatar's lifeless stare while your hands and head move freely in virtual space? VOCALINK captures real-time mouth and jaw movements using an OV2640 camera paired with machine learning, translating your natural expressions into authentic avatar animations that actually match how you speak, smile, and react.
